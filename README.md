## Note:

To anyone looking for my other repo. BYI-I contacted me and told me to take it down. Apparently, a CS 124 student blatantly plagiarized my work. I don't know all the details, but he/she must have to have been turning in whole, un-edited assignments; probably with my name still in the header (facepalm). If you're cheating that bad in CS 124, you won't make it in this program.

Anyway. That's the story. Sadly, one idiot ruined it for everyone. The university told me that the student is responsible for his/her actions but that I provided the temptation. I beg to differ. I've never minded helping other students out. We all need a little nudge when we get stuck, but that nudge can't turn into me carrying you. If this was a English program, would you blame an author for a student failing to cite a reference? You all get the idea. Well, it was a good run while it lasted.
